# Blanks-Program
This python program takes a powerpoint and makes it a fill in the blanks type document, and saves it as a new file. You can then quiz yourself on the information in the powerpoint. 
## Installation
The only thing you will have to import in addition is python-pptx, which can be installed via pip:
```
pip install python-pptx
```
