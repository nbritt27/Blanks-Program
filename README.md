# Blanks-Program
This python program takes a powerpoint and makes it a fill in the blanks type document, and saves it as a new file. You can then quiz yourself on the information in the powerpoint. 
## Installation
You will have to import in addition is python-pptx and python-docx, both of which can be installed via pip:
```
pip install python-pptx
```
```
pip install python-docx
```
To run the actual program, run 
```
python GUI.py
```
There is also an exe download available in the "dist" folder. It's still very buggy, and the actual study tool works about half the time. It contains the version of the program as of October 19, 2018, and I plan on updating it soon.
# Current Goals
I am working on making the program into an executable file for Windows, as well as adding support for Microsoft Word files.
