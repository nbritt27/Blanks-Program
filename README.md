# Blanks-Program
This python program takes a powerpoint and makes it a fill in the blanks type document, and saves it as a new file. You can then quiz yourself on the information in the powerpoint. 
## Installation
The only thing you will have to import in addition is python-pptx, which can be installed via pip:
```
pip install python-pptx
```
To run the actual program, run 
```
python GUI.py
```
# Current Goals
I am working on making the program into an executable file for Windows, as well as adding support for Microsoft Word files.
